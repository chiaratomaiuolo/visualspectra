Source code repository of a software tool for spectra visualization. It permits to open files contaning a list of radiation events, construct the relative histogram and visualize it through a GUI implemented with `ttkbootstrap`, hosting a `matplotlib` figure.  

In addition to spectra creation, the tool permits to perform basic analyses:
- ROI selection and its fit with a Gaussian model;
- ...

### Supported filetypes
